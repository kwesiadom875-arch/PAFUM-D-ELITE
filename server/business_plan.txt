Business Name: Parfum D'Élite 
Legal Structure: Partnership (Manu-Ofosu Agya-Kwesi Adom and Oscar Ekow Menya Mensah) 
Location: Accra, Ghana 
Business Model: E-commerce retailer of authentic designer and niche fragrances 
Mission Statement: We strive to be the most trusted and reliable online one-stop shop for authentic, curated perfumes, 
connecting enthusiasts with scents they know and love. 
Vision: To build a community and marketplace for fragrance collectors and consumers in Ghana. 
Funding Required: GHS 9,367 
First Year Revenue Target (Conservative): GHS 72,000 
Break-Even Timeline: Month 2 
1. Authenticity 
CORE VALUES 
We never compromise. Our reputation heavily relies on our customers knowing that everything they buy from us is 100% 
authentic. 
2. Trust 
We are not just selling fragrances, we're building relationships. That means being honest, shipping when we say we will, and 
treating every customer with respect. We are here to play the long game. 
3. Curation Excellence 
Most retailers list thousands of products. We are different. We are trend-setters and climate-optimizers. We should be proud 
of every single item in our collection because we chose it specifically for the Ghanaian market. 
4. Passion 
At the end of the day, we are here because we genuinely have love for this work. It is what makes us different from a 
faceless algorithm and turns a first-time buyer into a loyal customer. 
OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: CLIMATE-OPTIMIZED 
CURATION 
Unlike international retailers and even local competitors, we understand that fragrance performance varies dramatically in 
tropical climates. Each fragrance in our collection goes through a rigorous climate-testing process in Accra's heat and 
humidity to ensure: 
• Appropriate longevity - Fragrances that don't evaporate too quickly in high heat 
• Pleasant projection - Scents that enhance rather than overwhelm in warm weather 
• Proper note development - Fragrances where top, middle, and base notes develop beautifully despite humidity 
• Value for money - Only fragrances that perform exceptionally in Ghana's climate make it to our collection 
Testing Protocol: 
• Each new fragrance is worn and tested for minimum 1 week 
• Testing in multiple environments (indoor/outdoor, day/night) 
• Feedback collected from multiple testers with different skin types 
• Performance metrics tracked: longevity, projection, note development, customer satisfaction potential 
This climate-optimization process is our competitive moat—customers trust that every fragrance we stock will perform 
beautifully in Ghana's environment, not just in European showrooms.

Break-Even Analysis 
Fixed Costs (Monthly): 
• Marketing: GHS 1,000 
• Shipping supplies: GHS 83 (GHS 500/6 months) 
• Miscellaneous: GHS 167 
Total Monthly Fixed Costs: GHS 1,250 
 
Variable Costs per Bottle: 
• Product cost: GHS 131-328 (average GHS 143) 
• Shipping to customer: GHS 30 (if included in price, otherwise separate) 
 
 
Average Contribution Margin per Bottle: 
• Selling price: GHS 1,500 
• Variable cost: GHS 143 
• Contribution margin: GHS 1,357 
 
Break-Even in Units: GHS 1,250 ÷ GHS 1,357 = 0.9 bottles per month to cover fixed costs 
Break-Even in Revenue: 0.9 bottles × GHS 1,500 = GHS 1,350 per month 
Analysis: With extremely low break-even point, profitability is achieved immediately. The 
business model is highly scalable and low-risk from a financial perspective.

delays, and authenticity concerns

ordering

purchase
